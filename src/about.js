    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to NooWeather, where we believe that staying informed about the weather should be simple, intuitive, and beautiful. Our journey began with a simple idea: to create a weather app that cuts through the noise and delivers accurate, essential information in a way that's easy to understand at a glance.
